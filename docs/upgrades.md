# Upgrade Guide

How releases of this catalog are versioned, and how to pin your cluster against them.

## Versioning

This repository follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) on Git tags:

| Bump  | Trigger                                                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Patch | Upstream Helm chart bump that does not change the `openAPISchema`. Renovate auto-PRs these.            |
| Minor | New app added, new value field exposed, non-breaking dashboard metadata change.                        |
| Major | Breaking change in any `openAPISchema`, a Pattern A/B/C rewire, renamed `Kind`, or removed app.        |

Every tag has a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes. Major bumps include a `## Migration notes` section in the release body listing what changed and what action the operator needs to take.

## Pinning your cluster

Edit your `init.yaml` so the FluxCD `GitRepository` does **not** track `main` directly. Pick one of three patterns:

### Pattern A — Auto-patch within a minor line (recommended for most deployments)

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: cozyllm
  namespace: cozy-public
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
  ref:
    semver: '~1.4'           # any 1.4.x release, never 1.5.0 or later
  url: ssh://git@github.com/aenix-org/cozyllm.git
```

You get every patch bump (upstream chart pins, security fixes) automatically. Minor bumps stay opt-in.

### Pattern B — Hard pin to one tag (recommended for production-critical clusters)

```yaml
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
  ref:
    tag: v1.4.0
```

Nothing changes until you bump the tag manually. Strongest control, slowest cadence.

### Pattern C — Track `main` (dev / staging only)

```yaml
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
  ref:
    branch: main
```

Every push to `main` reconciles immediately. **Never use this in production** — a breaking commit lands instantly.

## Upgrading

### Patch / minor

Bump the `ref.semver` constraint or `ref.tag`, then commit your `init.yaml` change. Flux reconciles within `interval`. Existing CRs continue to render against the new chart version on next reconciliation — the cozystack controller picks up the schema change and re-renders the dashboard form.

### Major

1. Read the release notes' `## Migration notes` section before bumping.
2. Take a snapshot / backup of any stateful CR data that the migration touches (Postgres, persistent volumes).
3. Bump `ref.tag` (do not use `ref.semver: '^2.0'` for first major adoption — pin explicitly).
4. Apply, then watch the cozystack controller reconcile each affected `ApplicationDefinition` and its existing CRs.
5. Verify each affected app's dashboard form renders correctly and existing instances still report `READY=True`.

## Adding a new app to an existing pinned cluster

A new app shipped in `v1.5.0` (minor bump) does **not** require you to widen `ref.semver: '~1.4'` to `'~1.5'`. You can stay on `1.4.x` and skip the new app entirely. When you do want the new app, bump the constraint or the tag — Flux will materialise the new `ApplicationDefinition`, `HelmRepository`, namespaces, and `HelmChart` in one reconciliation.

## Release schedule

Renovate scans upstream Helm chart sources every Monday morning (Europe/Moscow timezone) and opens PRs for any chart bump it finds. After CI is green and the bump has been reviewed (patch bumps may auto-merge), the maintainer cuts a tag matching semver discipline and the `release.yml` workflow generates a GitHub Release.

## Schema-migration discipline

When you modify any `values.yaml`, regenerate `values.schema.json` (`make generate` in the app's directory) and mirror the new schema into `packages/core/platform/templates/cozyrds.yaml` under the app's `openAPISchema` field. The `openAPISchema` field title must always be exactly `"Chart Values"` — every form-rendering convention in the cozystack dashboard relies on this.

Breaking changes to `openAPISchema`:

- **Adding a required field**: major bump. Existing CRs may stop reconciling.
- **Removing a field**: major bump. Existing CRs will reject the new schema if they still carry the field.
- **Renaming a field**: major bump.
- **Tightening validation (new pattern, narrower enum)**: major bump.
- **Adding an optional field with a default**: minor bump. Safe.
- **Loosening validation (wider enum, looser pattern)**: minor bump. Safe.
- **Changing description / title**: patch bump. Cosmetic.
